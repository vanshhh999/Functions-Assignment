        "Q.1 What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Function: A function in Python is a block of reusable code defined using the def keyword, designed to perform a specific task. It is not bound to any class or object and can be called independently.\n",
        "- Method: A method is a function that is defined within a class and is associated with an object. It operates on data within the object and can access the instance or class variables through the self or cls keyword.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.2 Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        "- Parameters: These are placeholders or variables specified in a function definition to define the inputs the function expects. Parameters act as local variables inside the function, and they are assigned values when the function is called.\n",
        "- Arguments: These are the actual values or data passed to the function when it is called. Arguments are assigned to the corresponding parameters defined in the function.\n",
        "- Parameters define the input blueprint for a function.\n",
        "- Arguments are the real inputs provided to the function at runtime\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.3 What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        "- Standard Function\n",
        "- Function with Default Arguments\n",
        "- Function with Variable-Length Arguments\n",
        "- Lambda Function (Anonymous Function)\n",
        "- Recursive Function\n",
        "- Generator Function\n",
        "- Built-in Function Wrapping\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.4 What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        "- The return statement in a Python function is used to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- End the Function Execution: Once a return statement is encountered, the function terminates and control is passed back to the caller.\n",
        "- Return a Value to the Caller: It specifies the data (if any) that the function outputs after execution. This allows the function to pass results back for further use.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.5 What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "- Iterators:An iterator in Python is an object that implements the iterator protocol, which consists of the methods:__iter__(): Returns the iterator object itself.\n",
        "__next__(): Returns the next item in the sequence. Raises a StopIteration exception when no more items are available.\n",
        "- Iterables:\n",
        "An iterable is an object that can be looped over (iterated through) using a for loop or similar construct. It implements the __iter__() method, which returns an iterator.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.6 Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "- A generator in Python is a special type of iterable that generates values on the fly and produces items one at a time as needed, rather than storing them all in memory at once. Generators are a memory-efficient way to work with large datasets or streams of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.7 What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "- Memory Efficiency\n",
        "- Lazy Evaluation\n",
        "- Improved Performance\n",
        "- Simpler Code for Iterative Processes\n",
        "- Ability to Handle Infinite Sequences\n",
        "- Pipeline Compatibility\n",
        "- Easy to Implement Iterators.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.8 What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "- A lambda function in Python is an anonymous, inline function defined using the lambda keyword. It can take any number of arguments but can only contain a single expression. The result of the expression is returned automatically. Lambda functions are often used for short, throwaway functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.9 Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
        "- The map() function in Python is a built-in function used to apply a specified function to each item in an iterable (e.g., a list, tuple, or string) and returns an iterator with the transformed elements. It is particularly useful for performing element-wise transformations without requiring an explicit loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.10 What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n",
        "- The map(), reduce(), and filter() functions are all higher-order functions in Python, which means they accept other functions as arguments. These functions are commonly used for functional programming and processing iterables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.11  Using pen & Paper write the internal mechanism for sum operation using  reduce function on this given\n",
        "list:[47,11,42,13];\n",
